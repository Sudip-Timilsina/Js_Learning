## Introduction

This repository contains multiple JavaScript projects that I've built to explore and implement different web development techniques and effects. Each project covers specific use cases, from UI components like toggles and sliders to dynamic utilities like random image generators and clocks.

## Project List

1. **Auto-Text**  
   This project displays a text auto-typing effect, where the text gradually appears on the screen character by character.

2. **Calculator**  
   A basic calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

3. **Calendar**  
   A simple, interactive calendar that allows you to view and select dates.

4. **Dark Mode Toggle**  
   A button that toggles between dark and light mode for a webpage.

5. **Digital Clock**  
   A real-time digital clock that shows the current hour, minute, and second.

6. **Half-Screen Transition**  
   A transition effect that splits the screen in half and applies a transition animation.

7. **Project 1**  
   Placeholder for a project that can be described in more detail here.

8. **Random Image Generator**  
   This project dynamically generates random images from a set of predefined images on each click.

9. **Ripple Effect**  
   Adds a ripple effect to buttons or any other interactive elements when clicked.

10. **Testimonial Slider**  
    A slider that showcases user testimonials with smooth transitions between different testimonial slides.

11. **Text Scroll Effects**  
    A scrolling text effect that makes the text move across the screen in a visually engaging manner.

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sudip-Timilsina/Js_Learning_Project.git
2. Navigate to the project folder you want to run:
   ```bash
   cd project-folder-name
3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the project:
   ```bsah
   open index.html
(Alternatively, you can open the file in any web browser directly.)
